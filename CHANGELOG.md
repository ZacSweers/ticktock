1.0.0-2020d
-----------

_2020-10-30_

TickTock is now stable! We're adopting a combination of semantic versioning and suffixing the IANA version.

This means that the first three digits (`1.0.0`) is the semver and `-2020d` is the IANA version.

* Update to `androidx.startup` stable. 
* The Android `-base` artifacts have been merged into the core android artifacts.
* Fixed: JVM lazy zone rules are now properly updated and no longer contain a `tzdb.dat` file. We fixed our regeneration setup.
* New-ish: `ticktock-compiler` artifact, a simple CLI if you want to compile your own lazy zone rules.
* New-ish: `ticktock-gradle-plugin` artifact, a simple Gradle plugin for fetching, compiling, and packaging your own TZ data.
